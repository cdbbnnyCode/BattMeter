Here is a list of all of the components used on this board:
2x LM358 Dual Operational Amplifier
1x µA7805 5V Linear Regulator
1x 10µF Electrolytic Capacitor
7x Various 1/4W Resistors (see v1.2_voltages.txt for exact values)
5x 330Ω 1/4W Resistors (for the LEDs)
1x XT30U-M Connector (or whatever connector your batteries use)
5x 5mm LEDs (feel free to be creative with the colors!*)

* If you want even brightness, use 150Ω resistors on green and blue LEDs and 330Ω for LEDs in the red-yellow range.

Some ideas for improving this board:
* Add sticky foam to the back to avoid scratching up sufaces and/or short-circuiting when it is placed on a metal surface.
  Don't forget to add cutouts for the information on the back!
* 3D print a case for it--this might require modification of the connector arrangement and the LEDs.
